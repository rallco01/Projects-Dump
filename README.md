# What is this repo?
This is a repository of all the projects/small automations/tools I've made that I feel comfortable publishing.

Most of my projects lack documentation, simply because I had no intention publishing them as I wrote them. I'm working on writing up documentation for these projects in the form of ReadMe's, but this is a slow process.
